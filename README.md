# project-euler
My solutions to the Project Euler questions. Mostly done in Ruby, not the most efficient for many of these problems, but it's what I like using.

I have done many of these problems in other languages (mostly perl). In the past, I frequently attempted to solve everything without using any external libraries/packages. In this repo, I'm using this as an oppurtunity to become more acquainted with modern packages. 

There is a file called autoGenerateFiles.rb that crudely creates files contaning the problem statement and the appropriate file marker. Edit as needed if you'd like to reuse.
